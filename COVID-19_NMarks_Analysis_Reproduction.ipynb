For much of March 2020, the above expression provided a good fit to the data for Australia as a whole, as well as for most jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, over the last few days, some of the data began to diverge from a pure exponential, especially in Victoria. Consider the graph below, which attempts to fit a single exponential to the data. Even though the numbers are increasing sharply, as shown in the graph on the left, the behaviour is not purely exponential, as the data cannot be described by a straight line on a log-linear graph.

In the transition region between $t_1$ and $t_1 + 5 t_{\\text{half}}$ the growth rate is sub-exponential, while for $t > t_1 + 5 t_{\\text{half}}$ we have $dN/dt$ equal to a constant and hence the total number of cases $N$ increases linearly with time, as shown in the right-hand graph.

The plateau values reveal the steady-state case that needs to be accommodated by the hospital system.
